## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Titanic Dataset

This project delves into the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, focusing on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to unearth hidden patterns and trends.

### Data Cleaning

The meticulous data cleaning process ensured a solid foundation for subsequent analysis. Here's a breakdown of the key steps:

**1. Identifying Missing Values:**

- We meticulously examined the data to identify missing values across different variables.
- We employed techniques like `pandas.isnull().sum()` or similar functions to quantify missing values.

**2. Missing Value Imputation:**

- We addressed missing values using appropriate imputation techniques based on data type and distribution.
- **Numerical Data:**
    - **Normal Distribution:** For data with a normal (bell-shaped) distribution, we used the median for imputation as it is less susceptible to outliers compared to the mean. Libraries like `SciPy.stats.norm.fit` can be used to assess normality.
    - **Skewed Distribution:** When data exhibited a skewed distribution, we primarily used the median for imputation due to the potential influence of outliers on the mean. We explored the feasibility of using regression imputation in specific cases, but with careful consideration of whether the assumptions for regression are met when dealing with skewed data (e.g., using libraries like `scikit-learn.linear_model.LinearRegression`).
- **Categorical Data:**
    - Depending on the specific variable and the number of missing values, techniques like mode imputation (using `pandas.Series.mode()`) or creating a new category for missing values could be considered.

**3. Outlier Handling:**

- We identified outliers that could significantly impact the analysis. Techniques like boxplots, IQR (Interquartile Range), or statistical tests (e.g., Z-scores) can be used for outlier detection.
- Strategies like winsorizing (capping outliers to specific percentiles) or trimming (removing extreme outliers) were employed to mitigate their influence.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

After meticulously cleaning the data, we conducted comprehensive EDA to understand variable relationships and reveal hidden insights. This involved:

**1. Descriptive Statistics:**

- We summarized the data using measures like mean, median, standard deviation, and frequency tables with libraries like `pandas.DataFrame.describe()`.

**2. Data Visualization:**

- We created visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and boxplots using libraries like `matplotlib` or `Seaborn` to explore variable relationships and identify patterns.

**3. Variable Analysis:**

- We examined individual variables in detail, including:
    - Distribution (normal, skewed, etc.)
    - Missing value patterns
    - Potential relationships with other variables

The results of the EDA are documented in separate notebooks or scripts within this repository.

This comprehensive data cleaning and EDA process established a robust foundation for further analysis and, if applicable, machine learning modeling on the Titanic dataset.
